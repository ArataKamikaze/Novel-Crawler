<h1>Chapter 1001: Not Moving</h1>
<p>A faint fog seemed to appear on Joseph’s mysterious gray armor. The Bronze Sparrow Sword pierced through the armor and his chest. The tip of the sword was revealed behind him as flames burned crazily.</p>
<p>“Die!” Joseph felt that such an attack was already powerful enough. He steeled his heart and wanted to transfer his injuries to the Bronze Sparrow Sword.</p>
<p>As the Bronze Sparrow Sword had injured him, he could only transfer it to the Bronze Sparrow Sword and not Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, before he could use Hypocritical Transaction to transfer his injuries, the Bronze Sparrow Sword had already exploded. A terrifying explosive force exploded in Joseph’s body like a nuclear bomb.</p>
<p><em>Not good!</em> Joseph’s expression changed drastically. The explosion of the Bronze Sparrow Sword instantly made him lose his target of damage transfer. Ignoring the fact that his injuries couldn’t be transferred, even Lie probably couldn’t withstand such a terrifying explosion.</p>
<p>Almost instantly, Joseph activated Lie’s Wheel of Destiny: False God Statue.</p>
<p><em>Boom!</em></p>
<p>Joseph’s body was blasted apart by the flames, shocking everyone watching. No one expected such a situation to happen.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Joseph’s figure suddenly appeared in a corner of the arena as he half-knelt on the ground. He wasn’t blasted to death. What was blasted to death was a fake statue that was akin to an avatar.</p>
<p>However, the injuries he had suffered previously couldn’t be transferred out. His chest was dripping with blood as his face turned pale. He looked like he was in a terrible condition.</p>
<p>In the silent arena, Zhou Wen held the Bronze Sparrow Sword’s scabbard which spewed out flames. It condensed a new Bronze Sparrow Sword that looked flawless.</p>
<p>“Wow! Too powerful… What kind of Companion Beast is that? It’s so cool. I’ve decided! I’ll create such Companion Beast figurines in the future…” Li Benyi exclaimed excitedly.</p>
<p>Li Benyu wore an odd expression. Zhou Wen’s strike had indeed exceeded his imagination.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say you were not going to move?” Zhou Wen asked Joseph.</p>
<p>“You… pulled a trick…” Joseph’s expression turned nasty as he gritted his teeth and stood up. He stared at Zhou Wen and continued, “Don’t be too smug. Schemes can only last for a while. In front of true strength, scheming is useless. I’ll let you know what true strength is.”</p>
<p>With that said, the Guardian armor on Joseph’s body emitted a mysterious fog. His injured chest and armor rapidly recovered in the mysterious fog. In the blink of an eye, he returned to normal as though he had never been injured.</p>
<p><em>What powerful recovery ability. It’s actually stronger than my self-healing ability?</em> Li Xuan widened his eyes in disbelief.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, that shouldn’t be ordinary self-healing, right?” Feng Qiuyan said after some thought.</p>
<p>Sadie used the Eye of Odin to see more clearly. She said, “It really doesn’t look like self-healing. It’s more like some kind of time-reversal ability that reverts his state to before he was injured.”</p>
<p>“That works too? Isn’t this too much of a bug? Such a scumbag actually has such a powerful Guardian. How depressing,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>Lance pondered and said, “I don’t think it’s that easy to use such a powerful force like reversing the flow of time. Perhaps, Joseph needs to pay a certain price.”</p>
<p>“What kind of price could it be?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Lance shook his head.</p>
<p>In the spectator stands, many people from Frost City began shouting Joseph’s name in unison.</p>
<p>To be able to escape from such a huge explosion and instantly recover from his injuries, he looked as powerful as a god.</p>
<p>However, they didn’t dare underestimate Zhou Wen now. The strike from the Bronze Sparrow Sword had left them somewhat horrified. Even now, they still felt their scalps tingle when they thought of that strike.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, are you prepared to suffer the wrath of God’s chosen one?” Joseph said coldly as he stared at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned some armor and put it on. He said with a smile, “Since you can’t abide by the agreement, it’s my turn to stand here motionless and let you attack. Feel free to attack. I’m always a man of my word. I won’t run.”</p>
<p>These words made Joseph’s expression turn nasty. He originally imagined that he could use Hypocritical Transaction to teach Zhou Wen a lesson, but he never expected Zhou Wen to counter him.</p>
<p>Now, Joseph knew that he had to suppress Zhou Wen to protect the image he had painstakingly built up in Frost City.</p>
<p>“You are tempting fate.” Joseph’s figure appeared in front of Zhou Wen like a phantom as he punched him in the chest.</p>
<p>Unlike ordinary people’s boxing techniques, there was a ring on the middle finger of Joseph’s fist. There was a spike on the ring. It was a poison spike that came with Lie’s armor. Coupled with the use of Essence Energy’s Sweet-Talking Punch, the poison produced when the poisonous sting stabbed into one’s body could make one hallucinate.</p>
<p>Even if Joseph didn’t kill Zhou Wen, Zhou Wen would still fall into an illusion. If his will wasn’t firm, he would commit suicide even without needing Joseph to do a thing.</p>
<p><em>Clang!</em></p>
<p>However, when Joseph’s fist struck Zhou Wen’s body, the poisonous sting failed to penetrate the armor at all. Under the powerful impact, the poisonous sting nearly snapped, but the armor remained unharmed.</p>
<p>“Impossible? How can it have such powerful defense?” Joseph refused to believe that his Guardian powers couldn’t break through Zhou Wen’s armor.</p>
<p>With that, Joseph quickly moved as he brandished his fists and struck Zhou Wen with all his might.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wore the Shell Dragon Armor and had activated Absolute Defense. No matter how Joseph attacked, he couldn’t break through the armor.</p>
<p>No matter how strong Lie was, it hadn’t activated its Terror form. It was just too difficult to break through the Absolute Defense. Back then, Night Thearch hadn’t been able to directly penetrate the Absolute Defense, much less Joseph.</p>
<p>The people in the spectator stands were dumbfounded. Zhou Wen really stood there motionless, allowing Joseph to attack.</p>
<p>In their eyes, the god-like Joseph was now a weak child. No matter how he attacked, he couldn’t injure Zhou Wen at all.</p>
<p><em>That fellow… What’s going on…</em> A strange thought arose in many people’s hearts as they looked at Zhou Wen who was dressed in blue crystal armor as though he was protected by the stars.</p>
<p><em>Could it be that the strength of a Companion Beast is really stronger than a Guardian? </em>Although they were unwilling to believe it deep down, the image of a Guardian suddenly didn’t seem so lofty in their hearts when they saw Joseph fighting an adult like a child.</p>
<p>“What Companion Beast is this? It’s so powerful. Joseph can’t even leave a mark on the armor. It’s just too powerful…” Li Benyi’s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>Ya’er glanced at Li Benyi and felt that this fellow was so noisy as if he had never seen anything.</p>

<p>Ya’er glanced at Li Benyi and felt that this fellow was so noisy as if he had never seen anything.</p>
<h1>Chapter 1002: Subversion</h1>
<p>The spectator stands were dead silent as everyone stared blankly at the battle in the arena.</p>
<p>Perhaps it couldn’t be called a battle. It was like a naughty child challenging a giant. Even if the giant stood there without moving, the naughty child couldn’t injure the giant at all.</p>
<p>Just as Joseph had said, it seemed to be the difference in absolute strength.</p>
<p>“Why… Why is this happening… Why can’t I break it…” Joseph changed his skills in an attempt to break through Zhou Wen’s armor.</p>
<p>However, it was completely useless. No matter what skill he used, it was blocked by the crystal-like armor. It couldn’t injure Zhou Wen at all.</p>
<p>Joseph’s heart sank to the bottom. He never imagined that he would lose to Zhou Wen, nor did he believe that he, who had a Guardian, couldn’t defeat a human without a contracted Guardian.</p>
<p>However, the truth was right before him. His heart was already palpitating, and his hands were trembling even more because he couldn’t see any hope of victory.</p>
<p>Now, Joseph was already regretting his decision to challenge Zhou Wen. Why did this darn Zhou Wen have so many terrifying Companion Beasts?</p>
<p>“Even if I kill you, you won’t be able to kill me. From the looks of it, there’s no need to continue fighting. This battle is a draw,” said Joseph as he suddenly retreated. He still wanted to preserve his final dignity.</p>
<p>However, his words made even the locals who had supported him find it unacceptable. All of them felt their faces burn.</p>
<p>“A loss is a loss. What do you mean by a draw? Can’t you act like a man?” a hot-tempered man in the stands shouted.</p>
<p>This was also what many people thought. They felt that Joseph should fight to the end. Even if he lost, it wouldn’t be as embarrassing as now.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Joseph without any expression. All he did was slowly dispel the Shell Dragon Armor and Bronze Sparrow Sword. He held the Bamboo Blade and said, “I won’t use any Companion Beasts. I’ll only use this Essence Gold Bamboo Blade to fight you. Do you dare fight?”</p>
<p>Instantly, the entire arena fell silent. Everyone suspected that there was something wrong with their ears or that Zhou Wen had gone mad.</p>
<p>The highest level humans could reach was the Epic stage. If they didn’t use Mythical Companion Beasts, they had no right to fight Guardians.</p>
<p>They admitted that Zhou Wen’s Companion Beasts were very strong. They were practically invincible. Without using Tyrant Behemoth, he had completely suppressed Joseph, who had a Guardian.</p>
<p>However, this didn’t mean that they believed that Zhou Wen was qualified to fight Joseph without a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“Are you sure there’s nothing wrong with his brain?” Li Benyu was also stunned. He was originally rejoicing over Zhou Wen’s victory, but, to his surprise, Zhou Wen had said such crazy words.</p>
<p>Lance also stared at Zhou Wen with a burning gaze. He knew what Zhou Wen wanted to do because he had done the same thing, but he had failed.</p>
<p>“Of course he’s not crazy. He just wants to prove that a Guardian is nothing impressive. We humans can defeat a Guardian with our own strength,” Sadie said with a complicated expression.</p>
<p>Although this sounded terrifying, Sadie didn’t find it strange that Zhou Wen was capable of completing such a feat.</p>
<p>“But… Can humans really defeat Guardians?” Li Benyu couldn’t believe it.</p>
<p>Li Benyi also couldn’t believe it. He muttered to himself, “Using a human’s body to defeat a Guardian? Is that possible?”</p>
<p>Apart from Li Xuan, Feng Qiuyan, and Ya’er, no one in Frost City believed that Zhou Wen could do it.</p>
<p>Humans maxed out at the Epic stage. There was a huge gap between them and the Mythical stage. As for Guardians, they were the best amongst those at the Mythical stage. The difference between them was just too great. The gap was so wide that no one could see hope.</p>
<p>“Is he crazy? Without using a Companion Beast, he’s only at the Epic stage. What right does he have to fight the Guardian?”</p>
<p>“Victory blinds one.”</p>
<p>“I think victory makes people crazy.”</p>
<p>When the people in the stands snapped to their senses, they began discussing spiritedly. Clearly, they also felt that Zhou Wen had been blinded by victory.</p>
<p>“Are you really not going to use a Companion Beast to fight me?” Joseph looked at Zhou Wen in disbelief. He couldn’t believe that a person like Zhou Wen would make such a foolish decision.</p>
<p>“If I use a Companion Beast, even if it’s only at the Legendary stage, it will be considered my loss.” Zhou Wen immediately added, “However, I have a condition.”</p>
<p>“What condition?” Joseph found it normal. There was no reason for Zhou Wen to be such an idiot.</p>
<p>“Even if I lose using a Companion Beast, this battle can’t end before I admit defeat. Do you dare accept the challenge?” Zhou Wen had been observing the powers of Lie.</p>
<p>It was indeed a very strong Guardian. Although it wasn’t the kind with absolute strength, his abilities were unique.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was confident that he could defeat Joseph, who had Lie, but he wasn’t completely confident that he could completely destroy Lie before Joseph admitted defeat.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen had to force Joseph not to admit defeat. He had to fight him to the end.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Zhou Wen in shock, believing that he had definitely gone mad. How was this a condition? It was as though he had personally delivered himself to the gallows.</p>
<p>Joseph stared at Zhou Wen with bloodshot eyes. He felt like he had been greatly insulted.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to beat around the bush. Aren’t you just trying to say that we won’t rest until one of us dies? I’ll fulfill your wish. We won’t rest until one of us dies. However, if you use a Companion Beast, it will be your loss. I want you to commit suicide.” Joseph’s eyes were red as his face couldn’t help but grimace. His voice was filled with ruthlessness.</p>
<p>“Sure.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly.</p>
<p>“Everyone, you heard that, right? As a member of the Ultimate Family Clan, you can guarantee me fair treatment, right?” Joseph looked at the VIP stands in the arena and said.</p>
<p>There, the upper echelons of the Ultimate Family Clan were watching the battle.</p>
<p>“No one can violate the agreement here,” an elder said calmly as he walked to the stands.</p>
<p>Joseph was delighted when he saw the elder. He bowed respectfully before turning to Zhou Wen with a ferocious expression. “Zhou Wen, I’ll gladly accept your life.”</p>
<p>With that said, the Lie Guardian armor on Joseph’s body emitted a mysterious fog that charged at Zhou Wen with terrifying power.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already analyzed the various abilities of Lie back when Joseph attacked. He already had an idea of its strength.</p>
<p>He held the Bamboo Blade, but he didn’t pull it out of its scabbard. As though riding the wind and smoke like an immortal, he dodged Joseph’s strange attacks.</p>
<p>Everyone saw that Zhou Wen really didn’t use a Companion Beast and relied solely on his strength to fight Joseph. Furthermore, Joseph didn’t have the absolute advantage.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s elegant movement technique that resembled a transcendent flying immortal was deeply imprinted in many people’s minds.</p>
<p>“Can humans… really compete with Guardians?” The people who rejected the notion previously had their beliefs shaken.</p>
<p>That elegant figure was subverting their long-established beliefs.</p>
<h1>Chapter 1003: Slaying the Guardian</h1>
<p>Zhou Wen’s movement techniques and saber techniques were pleasing to the eye and looked extremely elegant.</p>
<p>Even with the help of the Guardian’s powers, Joseph’s Speed and Strength were stronger than Zhou Wen’s in all aspects; yet, he was ultimately unable to injure him.</p>
<p>Even ordinary people who didn’t know how strong or weak their combat strength was could tell that although Joseph’s Strength and Speed were great, his technique and realm were far inferior to Zhou Wen’s.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen relied solely on his technique and combat experience to forcefully make up for the difference in physique between the two.</p>
<p>The Mythical Transcendent Flying Immortal combined with the Mythical Heart Defying Sword made Zhou Wen appear no weaker in his battle with Joseph.</p>
<p>Joseph was alarmed. He believed that after having a Guardian, he was already one of the strongest humans. Ignoring normal humans, even people with Mythical Companion Beasts were probably no match for him.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t even use a Companion Beast. Just his strength, skills, and Essence Gold saber were enough to render him helpless. It was rather terrifying.</p>
<p>Joseph made up his mind. Previously, he had that strange sword that prevented the Guardian’s Hypocritical Transaction from finding a target to transfer. <em>Now that he can’t use Companion Beasts, I don’t believe that he can withstand the damage transfer. He can’t self-destruct, right?</em></p>
<p>However, with his previous experience, Joseph didn’t dare be careless against Zhou Wen. Although he felt that this move was feasible, he couldn’t activate the Wheel of Destiny again anytime soon. If his life ended up in danger, he couldn’t use the False God Statue to escape.</p>
<p>To prevent any accidents, Joseph made a decision.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used the Bamboo Blade as a sword and used the Heart Defying Sword to perfection. The might of his sword moves also became stronger.</p>
<p>As for Joseph, he seemed to be completely suppressed by Zhou Wen. He seemed to be retreating in defeat.</p>
<p>The spectators were already dumbfounded when they saw this. They couldn’t believe that an Epic human could suppress Joseph, who had a Guardian.</p>
<p>“Joseph seems to be deliberately luring Zhou Wen into delivering greater might with his sword,” Sadie said.</p>
<p>“That’s indeed the case. From the looks of it, he still plans on using that damage transfer ability,” said Lance.</p>
<p>“He still hasn’t learned his lesson after suffering a loss. He just has to do it again,” Li Xuan said with a curl of his lips.</p>
<p>“The situation now is probably a little different. Zhou Wen is using an ordinary Essence Gold weapon and not a saber transformed from a Companion Beast. It’s impossible for him to let the Bamboo Blade leave his hand to attack Joseph. If the damage is transferred, it can be transferred to Zhou Wen. Even if Zhou Wen were to throw the saber out, Zhou Wen’s situation will be very bad if the saber is destroyed,” Gulli said.</p>
<p>Lance thought for a moment, but he couldn’t think of a way for Zhou Wen to nullify the damage transfer. He pondered and said, “Since Zhou Wen has agreed not to use Companion Beasts, there should be a solution. Let’s continue watching.”</p>
<p>With Joseph luring Zhou Wen to use greater strength, Zhou Wen’s might grew stronger and stronger. This was also what Joseph wanted. He wanted to use damage transfer to kill Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Seeing that the time was ripe, Zhou Wen’s sword stance was like a storm. It was impossible for him to retract his force.</p>
<p>Joseph suddenly retreated, but the armor on his body condensed into a Guardian that looked like a devil. It faced the Bamboo Blade in Zhou Wen’s hand.</p>
<p>Bamboo Blade crisscrossed over Lie’s body like bolts of lightning, leaving deep marks on its body.</p>
<p>Without the augmentation of Mythical Strength, Zhou Wen’s Strength was still a little weak. The injuries he left on Lie weren’t deep.</p>
<p>Joseph was delighted when he saw this. Zhou Wen’s strength wasn’t as terrifying as he imagined. It was completely within the limits of Lie.</p>
<p>However, such a violent sword attack left many wounds in a short period of time. Even if these injuries couldn’t kill Zhou Wen, they could reduce him to a heavily injured state.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, you’re dead.” Joseph roared as he excitedly launched Hypocritical Transaction to transfer the Guardian’s injuries to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, in the next second, the excitement on Joseph’s face froze. He realized that the Guardian’s injuries couldn’t be transferred to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Impossible… How can this be… You cheated… You used the power of a Companion Beast to withstand the Guardian’s damage transfer?” Joseph roared at Zhou Wen with bloodshot eyes.</p>
<p>The people in the spectator stands also felt that what Joseph said wasn’t impossible. Otherwise, how could Zhou Wen, an Epic-stage human, suppress the Guardian so badly?</p>
<p>“Do I need to cheat?” Zhou Wen said calmly as the Bamboo Blade’s aura suddenly increased.</p>
<p>Instantly, Zhou Wen’s aura reached a terrifying level. At the instant he brandished the Bamboo Blade in his hand, he seemed to vanish.</p>
<p>When he appeared again, he was already at the other end of the arena. He slowly returned Bamboo Blade to its scabbard.</p>
<p><em>Crack!</em></p>
<p>And in the sky, Lie’s body split into two and was killed on the spot.</p>
<p>Not far behind the Guardian, Joseph spat out a mouthful of blood and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>The arena was silent. Those who had doubted Zhou Wen moments ago now felt the coldness deep in their bones.</p>
<p><em>Is there a need to cheat? It really doesn’t seem like there’s a need. </em>This thought appeared in everyone’s minds.</p>
<p><em>The strength of humans can really kill Guardians! </em>Apart from that, an unbelievable thought sprouted in everyone’s hearts.</p>
<p>“You cheated… You cheated… It’s impossible for human strength to defeat a Guardian… It’s impossible for you to defeat me, a chosen one of God… You must be cheating…” The wounds on Joseph’s body were still bleeding, but he seemed to have gone mad. He ignored his injuries and struggled to get up and shout.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t kill him. After all, he was from the Ultimate Family Clan. It was better to leave him to the Ultimate Family Clan to deal with.</p>
<p>He originally imagined that the matter would end here, but gray smoke suddenly rose from Joseph’s body as though his body was turning into dust.</p>
<p>As for the smoke, it condensed into the appearance of Lie above Joseph.</p>
<p>This strange scene left everyone horrified. As Joseph constantly screamed, his body quickly dissipated, and the smoke transformed into the complete Lie.</p>
<p>However, the current Lie looked much more agile and strange than the previous Lie.</p>
<p>“What happened? Aren’t Guardians supposed to protect contractors? Why did it devour Joseph?” Everyone felt their blood run cold.</p>
<p>Lie floated in the air as it looked at Zhou Wen with its demonic eyes and said, “You defeated Joseph. Now, you have the right to succeed Joseph as God’s chosen one. I will bestow you supreme power.”</p>
<h1>Chapter 1001: Not Moving</h1>
<p>A faint fog seemed to appear on Joseph’s mysterious gray armor. The Bronze Sparrow Sword pierced through the armor and his chest. The tip of the sword was revealed behind him as flames burned crazily.</p>
<p>“Die!” Joseph felt that such an attack was already powerful enough. He steeled his heart and wanted to transfer his injuries to the Bronze Sparrow Sword.</p>
<p>As the Bronze Sparrow Sword had injured him, he could only transfer it to the Bronze Sparrow Sword and not Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, before he could use Hypocritical Transaction to transfer his injuries, the Bronze Sparrow Sword had already exploded. A terrifying explosive force exploded in Joseph’s body like a nuclear bomb.</p>
<p><em>Not good!</em> Joseph’s expression changed drastically. The explosion of the Bronze Sparrow Sword instantly made him lose his target of damage transfer. Ignoring the fact that his injuries couldn’t be transferred, even Lie probably couldn’t withstand such a terrifying explosion.</p>
<p>Almost instantly, Joseph activated Lie’s Wheel of Destiny: False God Statue.</p>
<p><em>Boom!</em></p>
<p>Joseph’s body was blasted apart by the flames, shocking everyone watching. No one expected such a situation to happen.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Joseph’s figure suddenly appeared in a corner of the arena as he half-knelt on the ground. He wasn’t blasted to death. What was blasted to death was a fake statue that was akin to an avatar.</p>
<p>However, the injuries he had suffered previously couldn’t be transferred out. His chest was dripping with blood as his face turned pale. He looked like he was in a terrible condition.</p>
<p>In the silent arena, Zhou Wen held the Bronze Sparrow Sword’s scabbard which spewed out flames. It condensed a new Bronze Sparrow Sword that looked flawless.</p>
<p>“Wow! Too powerful… What kind of Companion Beast is that? It’s so cool. I’ve decided! I’ll create such Companion Beast figurines in the future…” Li Benyi exclaimed excitedly.</p>
<p>Li Benyu wore an odd expression. Zhou Wen’s strike had indeed exceeded his imagination.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say you were not going to move?” Zhou Wen asked Joseph.</p>
<p>“You… pulled a trick…” Joseph’s expression turned nasty as he gritted his teeth and stood up. He stared at Zhou Wen and continued, “Don’t be too smug. Schemes can only last for a while. In front of true strength, scheming is useless. I’ll let you know what true strength is.”</p>
<p>With that said, the Guardian armor on Joseph’s body emitted a mysterious fog. His injured chest and armor rapidly recovered in the mysterious fog. In the blink of an eye, he returned to normal as though he had never been injured.</p>
<p><em>What powerful recovery ability. It’s actually stronger than my self-healing ability?</em> Li Xuan widened his eyes in disbelief.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, that shouldn’t be ordinary self-healing, right?” Feng Qiuyan said after some thought.</p>
<p>Sadie used the Eye of Odin to see more clearly. She said, “It really doesn’t look like self-healing. It’s more like some kind of time-reversal ability that reverts his state to before he was injured.”</p>
<p>“That works too? Isn’t this too much of a bug? Such a scumbag actually has such a powerful Guardian. How depressing,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>Lance pondered and said, “I don’t think it’s that easy to use such a powerful force like reversing the flow of time. Perhaps, Joseph needs to pay a certain price.”</p>
<p>“What kind of price could it be?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Lance shook his head.</p>
<p>In the spectator stands, many people from Frost City began shouting Joseph’s name in unison.</p>
<p>To be able to escape from such a huge explosion and instantly recover from his injuries, he looked as powerful as a god.</p>
<p>However, they didn’t dare underestimate Zhou Wen now. The strike from the Bronze Sparrow Sword had left them somewhat horrified. Even now, they still felt their scalps tingle when they thought of that strike.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, are you prepared to suffer the wrath of God’s chosen one?” Joseph said coldly as he stared at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned some armor and put it on. He said with a smile, “Since you can’t abide by the agreement, it’s my turn to stand here motionless and let you attack. Feel free to attack. I’m always a man of my word. I won’t run.”</p>
<p>These words made Joseph’s expression turn nasty. He originally imagined that he could use Hypocritical Transaction to teach Zhou Wen a lesson, but he never expected Zhou Wen to counter him.</p>
<p>Now, Joseph knew that he had to suppress Zhou Wen to protect the image he had painstakingly built up in Frost City.</p>
<p>“You are tempting fate.” Joseph’s figure appeared in front of Zhou Wen like a phantom as he punched him in the chest.</p>
<p>Unlike ordinary people’s boxing techniques, there was a ring on the middle finger of Joseph’s fist. There was a spike on the ring. It was a poison spike that came with Lie’s armor. Coupled with the use of Essence Energy’s Sweet-Talking Punch, the poison produced when the poisonous sting stabbed into one’s body could make one hallucinate.</p>
<p>Even if Joseph didn’t kill Zhou Wen, Zhou Wen would still fall into an illusion. If his will wasn’t firm, he would commit suicide even without needing Joseph to do a thing.</p>
<p><em>Clang!</em></p>
<p>However, when Joseph’s fist struck Zhou Wen’s body, the poisonous sting failed to penetrate the armor at all. Under the powerful impact, the poisonous sting nearly snapped, but the armor remained unharmed.</p>
<p>“Impossible? How can it have such powerful defense?” Joseph refused to believe that his Guardian powers couldn’t break through Zhou Wen’s armor.</p>
<p>With that, Joseph quickly moved as he brandished his fists and struck Zhou Wen with all his might.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wore the Shell Dragon Armor and had activated Absolute Defense. No matter how Joseph attacked, he couldn’t break through the armor.</p>
<p>No matter how strong Lie was, it hadn’t activated its Terror form. It was just too difficult to break through the Absolute Defense. Back then, Night Thearch hadn’t been able to directly penetrate the Absolute Defense, much less Joseph.</p>
<p>The people in the spectator stands were dumbfounded. Zhou Wen really stood there motionless, allowing Joseph to attack.</p>
<p>In their eyes, the god-like Joseph was now a weak child. No matter how he attacked, he couldn’t injure Zhou Wen at all.</p>
<p><em>That fellow… What’s going on…</em> A strange thought arose in many people’s hearts as they looked at Zhou Wen who was dressed in blue crystal armor as though he was protected by the stars.</p>
<p><em>Could it be that the strength of a Companion Beast is really stronger than a Guardian? </em>Although they were unwilling to believe it deep down, the image of a Guardian suddenly didn’t seem so lofty in their hearts when they saw Joseph fighting an adult like a child.</p>
<p>“What Companion Beast is this? It’s so powerful. Joseph can’t even leave a mark on the armor. It’s just too powerful…” Li Benyi’s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>Ya’er glanced at Li Benyi and felt that this fellow was so noisy as if he had never seen anything.</p>
<h1>Chapter 1002: Subversion</h1>
<p>The spectator stands were dead silent as everyone stared blankly at the battle in the arena.</p>
<p>Perhaps it couldn’t be called a battle. It was like a naughty child challenging a giant. Even if the giant stood there without moving, the naughty child couldn’t injure the giant at all.</p>
<p>Just as Joseph had said, it seemed to be the difference in absolute strength.</p>
<p>“Why… Why is this happening… Why can’t I break it…” Joseph changed his skills in an attempt to break through Zhou Wen’s armor.</p>
<p>However, it was completely useless. No matter what skill he used, it was blocked by the crystal-like armor. It couldn’t injure Zhou Wen at all.</p>
<p>Joseph’s heart sank to the bottom. He never imagined that he would lose to Zhou Wen, nor did he believe that he, who had a Guardian, couldn’t defeat a human without a contracted Guardian.</p>
<p>However, the truth was right before him. His heart was already palpitating, and his hands were trembling even more because he couldn’t see any hope of victory.</p>
<p>Now, Joseph was already regretting his decision to challenge Zhou Wen. Why did this darn Zhou Wen have so many terrifying Companion Beasts?</p>
<p>“Even if I kill you, you won’t be able to kill me. From the looks of it, there’s no need to continue fighting. This battle is a draw,” said Joseph as he suddenly retreated. He still wanted to preserve his final dignity.</p>
<p>However, his words made even the locals who had supported him find it unacceptable. All of them felt their faces burn.</p>
<p>“A loss is a loss. What do you mean by a draw? Can’t you act like a man?” a hot-tempered man in the stands shouted.</p>
<p>This was also what many people thought. They felt that Joseph should fight to the end. Even if he lost, it wouldn’t be as embarrassing as now.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Joseph without any expression. All he did was slowly dispel the Shell Dragon Armor and Bronze Sparrow Sword. He held the Bamboo Blade and said, “I won’t use any Companion Beasts. I’ll only use this Essence Gold Bamboo Blade to fight you. Do you dare fight?”</p>
<p>Instantly, the entire arena fell silent. Everyone suspected that there was something wrong with their ears or that Zhou Wen had gone mad.</p>
<p>The highest level humans could reach was the Epic stage. If they didn’t use Mythical Companion Beasts, they had no right to fight Guardians.</p>
<p>They admitted that Zhou Wen’s Companion Beasts were very strong. They were practically invincible. Without using Tyrant Behemoth, he had completely suppressed Joseph, who had a Guardian.</p>
<p>However, this didn’t mean that they believed that Zhou Wen was qualified to fight Joseph without a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“Are you sure there’s nothing wrong with his brain?” Li Benyu was also stunned. He was originally rejoicing over Zhou Wen’s victory, but, to his surprise, Zhou Wen had said such crazy words.</p>
<p>Lance also stared at Zhou Wen with a burning gaze. He knew what Zhou Wen wanted to do because he had done the same thing, but he had failed.</p>
<p>“Of course he’s not crazy. He just wants to prove that a Guardian is nothing impressive. We humans can defeat a Guardian with our own strength,” Sadie said with a complicated expression.</p>
<p>Although this sounded terrifying, Sadie didn’t find it strange that Zhou Wen was capable of completing such a feat.</p>
<p>“But… Can humans really defeat Guardians?” Li Benyu couldn’t believe it.</p>
<p>Li Benyi also couldn’t believe it. He muttered to himself, “Using a human’s body to defeat a Guardian? Is that possible?”</p>
<p>Apart from Li Xuan, Feng Qiuyan, and Ya’er, no one in Frost City believed that Zhou Wen could do it.</p>
<p>Humans maxed out at the Epic stage. There was a huge gap between them and the Mythical stage. As for Guardians, they were the best amongst those at the Mythical stage. The difference between them was just too great. The gap was so wide that no one could see hope.</p>
<p>“Is he crazy? Without using a Companion Beast, he’s only at the Epic stage. What right does he have to fight the Guardian?”</p>
<p>“Victory blinds one.”</p>
<p>“I think victory makes people crazy.”</p>
<p>When the people in the stands snapped to their senses, they began discussing spiritedly. Clearly, they also felt that Zhou Wen had been blinded by victory.</p>
<p>“Are you really not going to use a Companion Beast to fight me?” Joseph looked at Zhou Wen in disbelief. He couldn’t believe that a person like Zhou Wen would make such a foolish decision.</p>
<p>“If I use a Companion Beast, even if it’s only at the Legendary stage, it will be considered my loss.” Zhou Wen immediately added, “However, I have a condition.”</p>
<p>“What condition?” Joseph found it normal. There was no reason for Zhou Wen to be such an idiot.</p>
<p>“Even if I lose using a Companion Beast, this battle can’t end before I admit defeat. Do you dare accept the challenge?” Zhou Wen had been observing the powers of Lie.</p>
<p>It was indeed a very strong Guardian. Although it wasn’t the kind with absolute strength, his abilities were unique.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was confident that he could defeat Joseph, who had Lie, but he wasn’t completely confident that he could completely destroy Lie before Joseph admitted defeat.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen had to force Joseph not to admit defeat. He had to fight him to the end.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Zhou Wen in shock, believing that he had definitely gone mad. How was this a condition? It was as though he had personally delivered himself to the gallows.</p>
<p>Joseph stared at Zhou Wen with bloodshot eyes. He felt like he had been greatly insulted.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to beat around the bush. Aren’t you just trying to say that we won’t rest until one of us dies? I’ll fulfill your wish. We won’t rest until one of us dies. However, if you use a Companion Beast, it will be your loss. I want you to commit suicide.” Joseph’s eyes were red as his face couldn’t help but grimace. His voice was filled with ruthlessness.</p>
<p>“Sure.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly.</p>
<p>“Everyone, you heard that, right? As a member of the Ultimate Family Clan, you can guarantee me fair treatment, right?” Joseph looked at the VIP stands in the arena and said.</p>
<p>There, the upper echelons of the Ultimate Family Clan were watching the battle.</p>
<p>“No one can violate the agreement here,” an elder said calmly as he walked to the stands.</p>
<p>Joseph was delighted when he saw the elder. He bowed respectfully before turning to Zhou Wen with a ferocious expression. “Zhou Wen, I’ll gladly accept your life.”</p>
<p>With that said, the Lie Guardian armor on Joseph’s body emitted a mysterious fog that charged at Zhou Wen with terrifying power.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already analyzed the various abilities of Lie back when Joseph attacked. He already had an idea of its strength.</p>
<p>He held the Bamboo Blade, but he didn’t pull it out of its scabbard. As though riding the wind and smoke like an immortal, he dodged Joseph’s strange attacks.</p>
<p>Everyone saw that Zhou Wen really didn’t use a Companion Beast and relied solely on his strength to fight Joseph. Furthermore, Joseph didn’t have the absolute advantage.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s elegant movement technique that resembled a transcendent flying immortal was deeply imprinted in many people’s minds.</p>
<p>“Can humans… really compete with Guardians?” The people who rejected the notion previously had their beliefs shaken.</p>
<p>That elegant figure was subverting their long-established beliefs.</p>
<h1>Chapter 1003: Slaying the Guardian</h1>
<p>Zhou Wen’s movement techniques and saber techniques were pleasing to the eye and looked extremely elegant.</p>
<p>Even with the help of the Guardian’s powers, Joseph’s Speed and Strength were stronger than Zhou Wen’s in all aspects; yet, he was ultimately unable to injure him.</p>
<p>Even ordinary people who didn’t know how strong or weak their combat strength was could tell that although Joseph’s Strength and Speed were great, his technique and realm were far inferior to Zhou Wen’s.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen relied solely on his technique and combat experience to forcefully make up for the difference in physique between the two.</p>
<p>The Mythical Transcendent Flying Immortal combined with the Mythical Heart Defying Sword made Zhou Wen appear no weaker in his battle with Joseph.</p>
<p>Joseph was alarmed. He believed that after having a Guardian, he was already one of the strongest humans. Ignoring normal humans, even people with Mythical Companion Beasts were probably no match for him.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t even use a Companion Beast. Just his strength, skills, and Essence Gold saber were enough to render him helpless. It was rather terrifying.</p>
<p>Joseph made up his mind. Previously, he had that strange sword that prevented the Guardian’s Hypocritical Transaction from finding a target to transfer. <em>Now that he can’t use Companion Beasts, I don’t believe that he can withstand the damage transfer. He can’t self-destruct, right?</em></p>
<p>However, with his previous experience, Joseph didn’t dare be careless against Zhou Wen. Although he felt that this move was feasible, he couldn’t activate the Wheel of Destiny again anytime soon. If his life ended up in danger, he couldn’t use the False God Statue to escape.</p>
<p>To prevent any accidents, Joseph made a decision.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used the Bamboo Blade as a sword and used the Heart Defying Sword to perfection. The might of his sword moves also became stronger.</p>
<p>As for Joseph, he seemed to be completely suppressed by Zhou Wen. He seemed to be retreating in defeat.</p>
<p>The spectators were already dumbfounded when they saw this. They couldn’t believe that an Epic human could suppress Joseph, who had a Guardian.</p>
<p>“Joseph seems to be deliberately luring Zhou Wen into delivering greater might with his sword,” Sadie said.</p>
<p>“That’s indeed the case. From the looks of it, he still plans on using that damage transfer ability,” said Lance.</p>
<p>“He still hasn’t learned his lesson after suffering a loss. He just has to do it again,” Li Xuan said with a curl of his lips.</p>
<p>“The situation now is probably a little different. Zhou Wen is using an ordinary Essence Gold weapon and not a saber transformed from a Companion Beast. It’s impossible for him to let the Bamboo Blade leave his hand to attack Joseph. If the damage is transferred, it can be transferred to Zhou Wen. Even if Zhou Wen were to throw the saber out, Zhou Wen’s situation will be very bad if the saber is destroyed,” Gulli said.</p>
<p>Lance thought for a moment, but he couldn’t think of a way for Zhou Wen to nullify the damage transfer. He pondered and said, “Since Zhou Wen has agreed not to use Companion Beasts, there should be a solution. Let’s continue watching.”</p>
<p>With Joseph luring Zhou Wen to use greater strength, Zhou Wen’s might grew stronger and stronger. This was also what Joseph wanted. He wanted to use damage transfer to kill Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Seeing that the time was ripe, Zhou Wen’s sword stance was like a storm. It was impossible for him to retract his force.</p>
<p>Joseph suddenly retreated, but the armor on his body condensed into a Guardian that looked like a devil. It faced the Bamboo Blade in Zhou Wen’s hand.</p>
<p>Bamboo Blade crisscrossed over Lie’s body like bolts of lightning, leaving deep marks on its body.</p>
<p>Without the augmentation of Mythical Strength, Zhou Wen’s Strength was still a little weak. The injuries he left on Lie weren’t deep.</p>
<p>Joseph was delighted when he saw this. Zhou Wen’s strength wasn’t as terrifying as he imagined. It was completely within the limits of Lie.</p>
<p>However, such a violent sword attack left many wounds in a short period of time. Even if these injuries couldn’t kill Zhou Wen, they could reduce him to a heavily injured state.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, you’re dead.” Joseph roared as he excitedly launched Hypocritical Transaction to transfer the Guardian’s injuries to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, in the next second, the excitement on Joseph’s face froze. He realized that the Guardian’s injuries couldn’t be transferred to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Impossible… How can this be… You cheated… You used the power of a Companion Beast to withstand the Guardian’s damage transfer?” Joseph roared at Zhou Wen with bloodshot eyes.</p>
<p>The people in the spectator stands also felt that what Joseph said wasn’t impossible. Otherwise, how could Zhou Wen, an Epic-stage human, suppress the Guardian so badly?</p>
<p>“Do I need to cheat?” Zhou Wen said calmly as the Bamboo Blade’s aura suddenly increased.</p>
<p>Instantly, Zhou Wen’s aura reached a terrifying level. At the instant he brandished the Bamboo Blade in his hand, he seemed to vanish.</p>
<p>When he appeared again, he was already at the other end of the arena. He slowly returned Bamboo Blade to its scabbard.</p>
<p><em>Crack!</em></p>
<p>And in the sky, Lie’s body split into two and was killed on the spot.</p>
<p>Not far behind the Guardian, Joseph spat out a mouthful of blood and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>The arena was silent. Those who had doubted Zhou Wen moments ago now felt the coldness deep in their bones.</p>
<p><em>Is there a need to cheat? It really doesn’t seem like there’s a need. </em>This thought appeared in everyone’s minds.</p>
<p><em>The strength of humans can really kill Guardians! </em>Apart from that, an unbelievable thought sprouted in everyone’s hearts.</p>
<p>“You cheated… You cheated… It’s impossible for human strength to defeat a Guardian… It’s impossible for you to defeat me, a chosen one of God… You must be cheating…” The wounds on Joseph’s body were still bleeding, but he seemed to have gone mad. He ignored his injuries and struggled to get up and shout.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t kill him. After all, he was from the Ultimate Family Clan. It was better to leave him to the Ultimate Family Clan to deal with.</p>
<p>He originally imagined that the matter would end here, but gray smoke suddenly rose from Joseph’s body as though his body was turning into dust.</p>
<p>As for the smoke, it condensed into the appearance of Lie above Joseph.</p>
<p>This strange scene left everyone horrified. As Joseph constantly screamed, his body quickly dissipated, and the smoke transformed into the complete Lie.</p>
<p>However, the current Lie looked much more agile and strange than the previous Lie.</p>
<p>“What happened? Aren’t Guardians supposed to protect contractors? Why did it devour Joseph?” Everyone felt their blood run cold.</p>
<p>Lie floated in the air as it looked at Zhou Wen with its demonic eyes and said, “You defeated Joseph. Now, you have the right to succeed Joseph as God’s chosen one. I will bestow you supreme power.”</p>
<h1>Chapter 1001: Not Moving</h1>
<p>A faint fog seemed to appear on Joseph’s mysterious gray armor. The Bronze Sparrow Sword pierced through the armor and his chest. The tip of the sword was revealed behind him as flames burned crazily.</p>
<p>“Die!” Joseph felt that such an attack was already powerful enough. He steeled his heart and wanted to transfer his injuries to the Bronze Sparrow Sword.</p>
<p>As the Bronze Sparrow Sword had injured him, he could only transfer it to the Bronze Sparrow Sword and not Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, before he could use Hypocritical Transaction to transfer his injuries, the Bronze Sparrow Sword had already exploded. A terrifying explosive force exploded in Joseph’s body like a nuclear bomb.</p>
<p><em>Not good!</em> Joseph’s expression changed drastically. The explosion of the Bronze Sparrow Sword instantly made him lose his target of damage transfer. Ignoring the fact that his injuries couldn’t be transferred, even Lie probably couldn’t withstand such a terrifying explosion.</p>
<p>Almost instantly, Joseph activated Lie’s Wheel of Destiny: False God Statue.</p>
<p><em>Boom!</em></p>
<p>Joseph’s body was blasted apart by the flames, shocking everyone watching. No one expected such a situation to happen.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Joseph’s figure suddenly appeared in a corner of the arena as he half-knelt on the ground. He wasn’t blasted to death. What was blasted to death was a fake statue that was akin to an avatar.</p>
<p>However, the injuries he had suffered previously couldn’t be transferred out. His chest was dripping with blood as his face turned pale. He looked like he was in a terrible condition.</p>
<p>In the silent arena, Zhou Wen held the Bronze Sparrow Sword’s scabbard which spewed out flames. It condensed a new Bronze Sparrow Sword that looked flawless.</p>
<p>“Wow! Too powerful… What kind of Companion Beast is that? It’s so cool. I’ve decided! I’ll create such Companion Beast figurines in the future…” Li Benyi exclaimed excitedly.</p>
<p>Li Benyu wore an odd expression. Zhou Wen’s strike had indeed exceeded his imagination.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say you were not going to move?” Zhou Wen asked Joseph.</p>
<p>“You… pulled a trick…” Joseph’s expression turned nasty as he gritted his teeth and stood up. He stared at Zhou Wen and continued, “Don’t be too smug. Schemes can only last for a while. In front of true strength, scheming is useless. I’ll let you know what true strength is.”</p>
<p>With that said, the Guardian armor on Joseph’s body emitted a mysterious fog. His injured chest and armor rapidly recovered in the mysterious fog. In the blink of an eye, he returned to normal as though he had never been injured.</p>
<p><em>What powerful recovery ability. It’s actually stronger than my self-healing ability?</em> Li Xuan widened his eyes in disbelief.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, that shouldn’t be ordinary self-healing, right?” Feng Qiuyan said after some thought.</p>
<p>Sadie used the Eye of Odin to see more clearly. She said, “It really doesn’t look like self-healing. It’s more like some kind of time-reversal ability that reverts his state to before he was injured.”</p>
<p>“That works too? Isn’t this too much of a bug? Such a scumbag actually has such a powerful Guardian. How depressing,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>Lance pondered and said, “I don’t think it’s that easy to use such a powerful force like reversing the flow of time. Perhaps, Joseph needs to pay a certain price.”</p>
<p>“What kind of price could it be?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Lance shook his head.</p>
<p>In the spectator stands, many people from Frost City began shouting Joseph’s name in unison.</p>
<p>To be able to escape from such a huge explosion and instantly recover from his injuries, he looked as powerful as a god.</p>
<p>However, they didn’t dare underestimate Zhou Wen now. The strike from the Bronze Sparrow Sword had left them somewhat horrified. Even now, they still felt their scalps tingle when they thought of that strike.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, are you prepared to suffer the wrath of God’s chosen one?” Joseph said coldly as he stared at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned some armor and put it on. He said with a smile, “Since you can’t abide by the agreement, it’s my turn to stand here motionless and let you attack. Feel free to attack. I’m always a man of my word. I won’t run.”</p>
<p>These words made Joseph’s expression turn nasty. He originally imagined that he could use Hypocritical Transaction to teach Zhou Wen a lesson, but he never expected Zhou Wen to counter him.</p>
<p>Now, Joseph knew that he had to suppress Zhou Wen to protect the image he had painstakingly built up in Frost City.</p>
<p>“You are tempting fate.” Joseph’s figure appeared in front of Zhou Wen like a phantom as he punched him in the chest.</p>
<p>Unlike ordinary people’s boxing techniques, there was a ring on the middle finger of Joseph’s fist. There was a spike on the ring. It was a poison spike that came with Lie’s armor. Coupled with the use of Essence Energy’s Sweet-Talking Punch, the poison produced when the poisonous sting stabbed into one’s body could make one hallucinate.</p>
<p>Even if Joseph didn’t kill Zhou Wen, Zhou Wen would still fall into an illusion. If his will wasn’t firm, he would commit suicide even without needing Joseph to do a thing.</p>
<p><em>Clang!</em></p>
<p>However, when Joseph’s fist struck Zhou Wen’s body, the poisonous sting failed to penetrate the armor at all. Under the powerful impact, the poisonous sting nearly snapped, but the armor remained unharmed.</p>
<p>“Impossible? How can it have such powerful defense?” Joseph refused to believe that his Guardian powers couldn’t break through Zhou Wen’s armor.</p>
<p>With that, Joseph quickly moved as he brandished his fists and struck Zhou Wen with all his might.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wore the Shell Dragon Armor and had activated Absolute Defense. No matter how Joseph attacked, he couldn’t break through the armor.</p>
<p>No matter how strong Lie was, it hadn’t activated its Terror form. It was just too difficult to break through the Absolute Defense. Back then, Night Thearch hadn’t been able to directly penetrate the Absolute Defense, much less Joseph.</p>
<p>The people in the spectator stands were dumbfounded. Zhou Wen really stood there motionless, allowing Joseph to attack.</p>
<p>In their eyes, the god-like Joseph was now a weak child. No matter how he attacked, he couldn’t injure Zhou Wen at all.</p>
<p><em>That fellow… What’s going on…</em> A strange thought arose in many people’s hearts as they looked at Zhou Wen who was dressed in blue crystal armor as though he was protected by the stars.</p>
<p><em>Could it be that the strength of a Companion Beast is really stronger than a Guardian? </em>Although they were unwilling to believe it deep down, the image of a Guardian suddenly didn’t seem so lofty in their hearts when they saw Joseph fighting an adult like a child.</p>
<p>“What Companion Beast is this? It’s so powerful. Joseph can’t even leave a mark on the armor. It’s just too powerful…” Li Benyi’s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>Ya’er glanced at Li Benyi and felt that this fellow was so noisy as if he had never seen anything.</p>
<h1>Chapter 1002: Subversion</h1>
<p>The spectator stands were dead silent as everyone stared blankly at the battle in the arena.</p>
<p>Perhaps it couldn’t be called a battle. It was like a naughty child challenging a giant. Even if the giant stood there without moving, the naughty child couldn’t injure the giant at all.</p>
<p>Just as Joseph had said, it seemed to be the difference in absolute strength.</p>
<p>“Why… Why is this happening… Why can’t I break it…” Joseph changed his skills in an attempt to break through Zhou Wen’s armor.</p>

<p>“If I use a Companion Beast, even if it’s only at the Legendary stage, it will be considered my loss.” Zhou Wen immediately added, “However, I have a condition.”</p>
<p>“What condition?” Joseph found it normal. There was no reason for Zhou Wen to be such an idiot.</p>
<p>“Even if I lose using a Companion Beast, this battle can’t end before I admit defeat. Do you dare accept the challenge?” Zhou Wen had been observing the powers of Lie.</p>
<p>It was indeed a very strong Guardian. Although it wasn’t the kind with absolute strength, his abilities were unique.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was confident that he could defeat Joseph, who had Lie, but he wasn’t completely confident that he could completely destroy Lie before Joseph admitted defeat.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen had to force Joseph not to admit defeat. He had to fight him to the end.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Zhou Wen in shock, believing that he had definitely gone mad. How was this a condition? It was as though he had personally delivered himself to the gallows.</p>
<p>Joseph stared at Zhou Wen with bloodshot eyes. He felt like he had been greatly insulted.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to beat around the bush. Aren’t you just trying to say that we won’t rest until one of us dies? I’ll fulfill your wish. We won’t rest until one of us dies. However, if you use a Companion Beast, it will be your loss. I want you to commit suicide.” Joseph’s eyes were red as his face couldn’t help but grimace. His voice was filled with ruthlessness.</p>
<p>“Sure.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly.</p>
<p>“Everyone, you heard that, right? As a member of the Ultimate Family Clan, you can guarantee me fair treatment, right?” Joseph looked at the VIP stands in the arena and said.</p>
<p>There, the upper echelons of the Ultimate Family Clan were watching the battle.</p>
<p>“No one can violate the agreement here,” an elder said calmly as he walked to the stands.</p>
<p>Joseph was delighted when he saw the elder. He bowed respectfully before turning to Zhou Wen with a ferocious expression. “Zhou Wen, I’ll gladly accept your life.”</p>
<p>With that said, the Lie Guardian armor on Joseph’s body emitted a mysterious fog that charged at Zhou Wen with terrifying power.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already analyzed the various abilities of Lie back when Joseph attacked. He already had an idea of its strength.</p>
<p>He held the Bamboo Blade, but he didn’t pull it out of its scabbard. As though riding the wind and smoke like an immortal, he dodged Joseph’s strange attacks.</p>
<p>Everyone saw that Zhou Wen really didn’t use a Companion Beast and relied solely on his strength to fight Joseph. Furthermore, Joseph didn’t have the absolute advantage.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s elegant movement technique that resembled a transcendent flying immortal was deeply imprinted in many people’s minds.</p>
<p>“Can humans… really compete with Guardians?” The people who rejected the notion previously had their beliefs shaken.</p>
<p>That elegant figure was subverting their long-established beliefs.</p>
<h1>Chapter 1003: Slaying the Guardian</h1>
<p>Zhou Wen’s movement techniques and saber techniques were pleasing to the eye and looked extremely elegant.</p>
<p>Even with the help of the Guardian’s powers, Joseph’s Speed and Strength were stronger than Zhou Wen’s in all aspects; yet, he was ultimately unable to injure him.</p>
<p>Even ordinary people who didn’t know how strong or weak their combat strength was could tell that although Joseph’s Strength and Speed were great, his technique and realm were far inferior to Zhou Wen’s.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen relied solely on his technique and combat experience to forcefully make up for the difference in physique between the two.</p>
<p>The Mythical Transcendent Flying Immortal combined with the Mythical Heart Defying Sword made Zhou Wen appear no weaker in his battle with Joseph.</p>
<p>Joseph was alarmed. He believed that after having a Guardian, he was already one of the strongest humans. Ignoring normal humans, even people with Mythical Companion Beasts were probably no match for him.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t even use a Companion Beast. Just his strength, skills, and Essence Gold saber were enough to render him helpless. It was rather terrifying.</p>
<p>Joseph made up his mind. Previously, he had that strange sword that prevented the Guardian’s Hypocritical Transaction from finding a target to transfer. <em>Now that he can’t use Companion Beasts, I don’t believe that he can withstand the damage transfer. He can’t self-destruct, right?</em></p>
<p>However, with his previous experience, Joseph didn’t dare be careless against Zhou Wen. Although he felt that this move was feasible, he couldn’t activate the Wheel of Destiny again anytime soon. If his life ended up in danger, he couldn’t use the False God Statue to escape.</p>
<p>To prevent any accidents, Joseph made a decision.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used the Bamboo Blade as a sword and used the Heart Defying Sword to perfection. The might of his sword moves also became stronger.</p>
<p>As for Joseph, he seemed to be completely suppressed by Zhou Wen. He seemed to be retreating in defeat.</p>
<p>The spectators were already dumbfounded when they saw this. They couldn’t believe that an Epic human could suppress Joseph, who had a Guardian.</p>
<p>“Joseph seems to be deliberately luring Zhou Wen into delivering greater might with his sword,” Sadie said.</p>
<p>“That’s indeed the case. From the looks of it, he still plans on using that damage transfer ability,” said Lance.</p>
<p>“He still hasn’t learned his lesson after suffering a loss. He just has to do it again,” Li Xuan said with a curl of his lips.</p>
<p>“The situation now is probably a little different. Zhou Wen is using an ordinary Essence Gold weapon and not a saber transformed from a Companion Beast. It’s impossible for him to let the Bamboo Blade leave his hand to attack Joseph. If the damage is transferred, it can be transferred to Zhou Wen. Even if Zhou Wen were to throw the saber out, Zhou Wen’s situation will be very bad if the saber is destroyed,” Gulli said.</p>
<p>Lance thought for a moment, but he couldn’t think of a way for Zhou Wen to nullify the damage transfer. He pondered and said, “Since Zhou Wen has agreed not to use Companion Beasts, there should be a solution. Let’s continue watching.”</p>
<p>With Joseph luring Zhou Wen to use greater strength, Zhou Wen’s might grew stronger and stronger. This was also what Joseph wanted. He wanted to use damage transfer to kill Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Seeing that the time was ripe, Zhou Wen’s sword stance was like a storm. It was impossible for him to retract his force.</p>
<p>Joseph suddenly retreated, but the armor on his body condensed into a Guardian that looked like a devil. It faced the Bamboo Blade in Zhou Wen’s hand.</p>
<p>Bamboo Blade crisscrossed over Lie’s body like bolts of lightning, leaving deep marks on its body.</p>
<p>Without the augmentation of Mythical Strength, Zhou Wen’s Strength was still a little weak. The injuries he left on Lie weren’t deep.</p>
<p>Joseph was delighted when he saw this. Zhou Wen’s strength wasn’t as terrifying as he imagined. It was completely within the limits of Lie.</p>
<p>However, such a violent sword attack left many wounds in a short period of time. Even if these injuries couldn’t kill Zhou Wen, they could reduce him to a heavily injured state.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, you’re dead.” Joseph roared as he excitedly launched Hypocritical Transaction to transfer the Guardian’s injuries to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, in the next second, the excitement on Joseph’s face froze. He realized that the Guardian’s injuries couldn’t be transferred to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Impossible… How can this be… You cheated… You used the power of a Companion Beast to withstand the Guardian’s damage transfer?” Joseph roared at Zhou Wen with bloodshot eyes.</p>
<p>The people in the spectator stands also felt that what Joseph said wasn’t impossible. Otherwise, how could Zhou Wen, an Epic-stage human, suppress the Guardian so badly?</p>
<p>“Do I need to cheat?” Zhou Wen said calmly as the Bamboo Blade’s aura suddenly increased.</p>
<p>Instantly, Zhou Wen’s aura reached a terrifying level. At the instant he brandished the Bamboo Blade in his hand, he seemed to vanish.</p>
<p>When he appeared again, he was already at the other end of the arena. He slowly returned Bamboo Blade to its scabbard.</p>
<p><em>Crack!</em></p>
<p>And in the sky, Lie’s body split into two and was killed on the spot.</p>
<p>Not far behind the Guardian, Joseph spat out a mouthful of blood and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>The arena was silent. Those who had doubted Zhou Wen moments ago now felt the coldness deep in their bones.</p>
<p><em>Is there a need to cheat? It really doesn’t seem like there’s a need. </em>This thought appeared in everyone’s minds.</p>
<p><em>The strength of humans can really kill Guardians! </em>Apart from that, an unbelievable thought sprouted in everyone’s hearts.</p>
<p>“You cheated… You cheated… It’s impossible for human strength to defeat a Guardian… It’s impossible for you to defeat me, a chosen one of God… You must be cheating…” The wounds on Joseph’s body were still bleeding, but he seemed to have gone mad. He ignored his injuries and struggled to get up and shout.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t kill him. After all, he was from the Ultimate Family Clan. It was better to leave him to the Ultimate Family Clan to deal with.</p>
<p>He originally imagined that the matter would end here, but gray smoke suddenly rose from Joseph’s body as though his body was turning into dust.</p>
<p>As for the smoke, it condensed into the appearance of Lie above Joseph.</p>
<p>This strange scene left everyone horrified. As Joseph constantly screamed, his body quickly dissipated, and the smoke transformed into the complete Lie.</p>
<p>However, the current Lie looked much more agile and strange than the previous Lie.</p>
<p>“What happened? Aren’t Guardians supposed to protect contractors? Why did it devour Joseph?” Everyone felt their blood run cold.</p>
<p>Lie floated in the air as it looked at Zhou Wen with its demonic eyes and said, “You defeated Joseph. Now, you have the right to succeed Joseph as God’s chosen one. I will bestow you supreme power.”</p>
<h1>Chapter 1001: Not Moving</h1>
<p>A faint fog seemed to appear on Joseph’s mysterious gray armor. The Bronze Sparrow Sword pierced through the armor and his chest. The tip of the sword was revealed behind him as flames burned crazily.</p>
<p>“Die!” Joseph felt that such an attack was already powerful enough. He steeled his heart and wanted to transfer his injuries to the Bronze Sparrow Sword.</p>
<p>As the Bronze Sparrow Sword had injured him, he could only transfer it to the Bronze Sparrow Sword and not Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, before he could use Hypocritical Transaction to transfer his injuries, the Bronze Sparrow Sword had already exploded. A terrifying explosive force exploded in Joseph’s body like a nuclear bomb.</p>
<p><em>Not good!</em> Joseph’s expression changed drastically. The explosion of the Bronze Sparrow Sword instantly made him lose his target of damage transfer. Ignoring the fact that his injuries couldn’t be transferred, even Lie probably couldn’t withstand such a terrifying explosion.</p>
<p>Almost instantly, Joseph activated Lie’s Wheel of Destiny: False God Statue.</p>
<p><em>Boom!</em></p>
<p>Joseph’s body was blasted apart by the flames, shocking everyone watching. No one expected such a situation to happen.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Joseph’s figure suddenly appeared in a corner of the arena as he half-knelt on the ground. He wasn’t blasted to death. What was blasted to death was a fake statue that was akin to an avatar.</p>
<p>However, the injuries he had suffered previously couldn’t be transferred out. His chest was dripping with blood as his face turned pale. He looked like he was in a terrible condition.</p>
<p>In the silent arena, Zhou Wen held the Bronze Sparrow Sword’s scabbard which spewed out flames. It condensed a new Bronze Sparrow Sword that looked flawless.</p>
<p>“Wow! Too powerful… What kind of Companion Beast is that? It’s so cool. I’ve decided! I’ll create such Companion Beast figurines in the future…” Li Benyi exclaimed excitedly.</p>
<p>Li Benyu wore an odd expression. Zhou Wen’s strike had indeed exceeded his imagination.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say you were not going to move?” Zhou Wen asked Joseph.</p>
<p>“You… pulled a trick…” Joseph’s expression turned nasty as he gritted his teeth and stood up. He stared at Zhou Wen and continued, “Don’t be too smug. Schemes can only last for a while. In front of true strength, scheming is useless. I’ll let you know what true strength is.”</p>
<p>With that said, the Guardian armor on Joseph’s body emitted a mysterious fog. His injured chest and armor rapidly recovered in the mysterious fog. In the blink of an eye, he returned to normal as though he had never been injured.</p>
<p><em>What powerful recovery ability. It’s actually stronger than my self-healing ability?</em> Li Xuan widened his eyes in disbelief.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, that shouldn’t be ordinary self-healing, right?” Feng Qiuyan said after some thought.</p>
<p>Sadie used the Eye of Odin to see more clearly. She said, “It really doesn’t look like self-healing. It’s more like some kind of time-reversal ability that reverts his state to before he was injured.”</p>
<p>“That works too? Isn’t this too much of a bug? Such a scumbag actually has such a powerful Guardian. How depressing,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>Lance pondered and said, “I don’t think it’s that easy to use such a powerful force like reversing the flow of time. Perhaps, Joseph needs to pay a certain price.”</p>
<p>“What kind of price could it be?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Lance shook his head.</p>
<p>In the spectator stands, many people from Frost City began shouting Joseph’s name in unison.</p>
<p>To be able to escape from such a huge explosion and instantly recover from his injuries, he looked as powerful as a god.</p>
<p>However, they didn’t dare underestimate Zhou Wen now. The strike from the Bronze Sparrow Sword had left them somewhat horrified. Even now, they still felt their scalps tingle when they thought of that strike.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, are you prepared to suffer the wrath of God’s chosen one?” Joseph said coldly as he stared at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned some armor and put it on. He said with a smile, “Since you can’t abide by the agreement, it’s my turn to stand here motionless and let you attack. Feel free to attack. I’m always a man of my word. I won’t run.”</p>
<p>These words made Joseph’s expression turn nasty. He originally imagined that he could use Hypocritical Transaction to teach Zhou Wen a lesson, but he never expected Zhou Wen to counter him.</p>
<p>Now, Joseph knew that he had to suppress Zhou Wen to protect the image he had painstakingly built up in Frost City.</p>
<p>“You are tempting fate.” Joseph’s figure appeared in front of Zhou Wen like a phantom as he punched him in the chest.</p>
<p>Unlike ordinary people’s boxing techniques, there was a ring on the middle finger of Joseph’s fist. There was a spike on the ring. It was a poison spike that came with Lie’s armor. Coupled with the use of Essence Energy’s Sweet-Talking Punch, the poison produced when the poisonous sting stabbed into one’s body could make one hallucinate.</p>
<p>Even if Joseph didn’t kill Zhou Wen, Zhou Wen would still fall into an illusion. If his will wasn’t firm, he would commit suicide even without needing Joseph to do a thing.</p>
<p><em>Clang!</em></p>
<p>However, when Joseph’s fist struck Zhou Wen’s body, the poisonous sting failed to penetrate the armor at all. Under the powerful impact, the poisonous sting nearly snapped, but the armor remained unharmed.</p>
<p>“Impossible? How can it have such powerful defense?” Joseph refused to believe that his Guardian powers couldn’t break through Zhou Wen’s armor.</p>
<p>With that, Joseph quickly moved as he brandished his fists and struck Zhou Wen with all his might.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wore the Shell Dragon Armor and had activated Absolute Defense. No matter how Joseph attacked, he couldn’t break through the armor.</p>
<p>No matter how strong Lie was, it hadn’t activated its Terror form. It was just too difficult to break through the Absolute Defense. Back then, Night Thearch hadn’t been able to directly penetrate the Absolute Defense, much less Joseph.</p>
<p>The people in the spectator stands were dumbfounded. Zhou Wen really stood there motionless, allowing Joseph to attack.</p>
<p>In their eyes, the god-like Joseph was now a weak child. No matter how he attacked, he couldn’t injure Zhou Wen at all.</p>
<p><em>That fellow… What’s going on…</em> A strange thought arose in many people’s hearts as they looked at Zhou Wen who was dressed in blue crystal armor as though he was protected by the stars.</p>
<p><em>Could it be that the strength of a Companion Beast is really stronger than a Guardian? </em>Although they were unwilling to believe it deep down, the image of a Guardian suddenly didn’t seem so lofty in their hearts when they saw Joseph fighting an adult like a child.</p>
<p>“What Companion Beast is this? It’s so powerful. Joseph can’t even leave a mark on the armor. It’s just too powerful…” Li Benyi’s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>Ya’er glanced at Li Benyi and felt that this fellow was so noisy as if he had never seen anything.</p>
<h1>Chapter 1002: Subversion</h1>
<p>The spectator stands were dead silent as everyone stared blankly at the battle in the arena.</p>
<p>Perhaps it couldn’t be called a battle. It was like a naughty child challenging a giant. Even if the giant stood there without moving, the naughty child couldn’t injure the giant at all.</p>
<p>Just as Joseph had said, it seemed to be the difference in absolute strength.</p>
<p>“Why… Why is this happening… Why can’t I break it…” Joseph changed his skills in an attempt to break through Zhou Wen’s armor.</p>
<p>However, it was completely useless. No matter what skill he used, it was blocked by the crystal-like armor. It couldn’t injure Zhou Wen at all.</p>
<p>Joseph’s heart sank to the bottom. He never imagined that he would lose to Zhou Wen, nor did he believe that he, who had a Guardian, couldn’t defeat a human without a contracted Guardian.</p>
<p>However, the truth was right before him. His heart was already palpitating, and his hands were trembling even more because he couldn’t see any hope of victory.</p>
<p>Now, Joseph was already regretting his decision to challenge Zhou Wen. Why did this darn Zhou Wen have so many terrifying Companion Beasts?</p>
<p>“Even if I kill you, you won’t be able to kill me. From the looks of it, there’s no need to continue fighting. This battle is a draw,” said Joseph as he suddenly retreated. He still wanted to preserve his final dignity.</p>
<p>However, his words made even the locals who had supported him find it unacceptable. All of them felt their faces burn.</p>
<p>“A loss is a loss. What do you mean by a draw? Can’t you act like a man?” a hot-tempered man in the stands shouted.</p>
<p>This was also what many people thought. They felt that Joseph should fight to the end. Even if he lost, it wouldn’t be as embarrassing as now.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Joseph without any expression. All he did was slowly dispel the Shell Dragon Armor and Bronze Sparrow Sword. He held the Bamboo Blade and said, “I won’t use any Companion Beasts. I’ll only use this Essence Gold Bamboo Blade to fight you. Do you dare fight?”</p>
<p>Instantly, the entire arena fell silent. Everyone suspected that there was something wrong with their ears or that Zhou Wen had gone mad.</p>
<p>The highest level humans could reach was the Epic stage. If they didn’t use Mythical Companion Beasts, they had no right to fight Guardians.</p>
<p>They admitted that Zhou Wen’s Companion Beasts were very strong. They were practically invincible. Without using Tyrant Behemoth, he had completely suppressed Joseph, who had a Guardian.</p>
<p>However, this didn’t mean that they believed that Zhou Wen was qualified to fight Joseph without a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“Are you sure there’s nothing wrong with his brain?” Li Benyu was also stunned. He was originally rejoicing over Zhou Wen’s victory, but, to his surprise, Zhou Wen had said such crazy words.</p>
<p>Lance also stared at Zhou Wen with a burning gaze. He knew what Zhou Wen wanted to do because he had done the same thing, but he had failed.</p>
<p>“Of course he’s not crazy. He just wants to prove that a Guardian is nothing impressive. We humans can defeat a Guardian with our own strength,” Sadie said with a complicated expression.</p>
<p>Although this sounded terrifying, Sadie didn’t find it strange that Zhou Wen was capable of completing such a feat.</p>
<p>“But… Can humans really defeat Guardians?” Li Benyu couldn’t believe it.</p>
<p>Li Benyi also couldn’t believe it. He muttered to himself, “Using a human’s body to defeat a Guardian? Is that possible?”</p>
<p>Apart from Li Xuan, Feng Qiuyan, and Ya’er, no one in Frost City believed that Zhou Wen could do it.</p>
<p>Humans maxed out at the Epic stage. There was a huge gap between them and the Mythical stage. As for Guardians, they were the best amongst those at the Mythical stage. The difference between them was just too great. The gap was so wide that no one could see hope.</p>
<p>“Is he crazy? Without using a Companion Beast, he’s only at the Epic stage. What right does he have to fight the Guardian?”</p>
<p>“Victory blinds one.”</p>
<p>“I think victory makes people crazy.”</p>
<p>When the people in the stands snapped to their senses, they began discussing spiritedly. Clearly, they also felt that Zhou Wen had been blinded by victory.</p>
<p>“Are you really not going to use a Companion Beast to fight me?” Joseph looked at Zhou Wen in disbelief. He couldn’t believe that a person like Zhou Wen would make such a foolish decision.</p>
<p>“If I use a Companion Beast, even if it’s only at the Legendary stage, it will be considered my loss.” Zhou Wen immediately added, “However, I have a condition.”</p>
<p>“What condition?” Joseph found it normal. There was no reason for Zhou Wen to be such an idiot.</p>
<p>“Even if I lose using a Companion Beast, this battle can’t end before I admit defeat. Do you dare accept the challenge?” Zhou Wen had been observing the powers of Lie.</p>
<p>It was indeed a very strong Guardian. Although it wasn’t the kind with absolute strength, his abilities were unique.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was confident that he could defeat Joseph, who had Lie, but he wasn’t completely confident that he could completely destroy Lie before Joseph admitted defeat.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen had to force Joseph not to admit defeat. He had to fight him to the end.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Zhou Wen in shock, believing that he had definitely gone mad. How was this a condition? It was as though he had personally delivered himself to the gallows.</p>
<p>Joseph stared at Zhou Wen with bloodshot eyes. He felt like he had been greatly insulted.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to beat around the bush. Aren’t you just trying to say that we won’t rest until one of us dies? I’ll fulfill your wish. We won’t rest until one of us dies. However, if you use a Companion Beast, it will be your loss. I want you to commit suicide.” Joseph’s eyes were red as his face couldn’t help but grimace. His voice was filled with ruthlessness.</p>
<p>“Sure.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly.</p>
<p>“Everyone, you heard that, right? As a member of the Ultimate Family Clan, you can guarantee me fair treatment, right?” Joseph looked at the VIP stands in the arena and said.</p>
<p>There, the upper echelons of the Ultimate Family Clan were watching the battle.</p>
<p>“No one can violate the agreement here,” an elder said calmly as he walked to the stands.</p>
<p>Joseph was delighted when he saw the elder. He bowed respectfully before turning to Zhou Wen with a ferocious expression. “Zhou Wen, I’ll gladly accept your life.”</p>
<p>With that said, the Lie Guardian armor on Joseph’s body emitted a mysterious fog that charged at Zhou Wen with terrifying power.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already analyzed the various abilities of Lie back when Joseph attacked. He already had an idea of its strength.</p>
<p>He held the Bamboo Blade, but he didn’t pull it out of its scabbard. As though riding the wind and smoke like an immortal, he dodged Joseph’s strange attacks.</p>

<p>Lance thought for a moment, but he couldn’t think of a way for Zhou Wen to nullify the damage transfer. He pondered and said, “Since Zhou Wen has agreed not to use Companion Beasts, there should be a solution. Let’s continue watching.”</p>

<p>However, in the next second, the excitement on Joseph’s face froze. He realized that the Guardian’s injuries couldn’t be transferred to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Impossible… How can this be… You cheated… You used the power of a Companion Beast to withstand the Guardian’s damage transfer?” Joseph roared at Zhou Wen with bloodshot eyes.</p>
<p>The people in the spectator stands also felt that what Joseph said wasn’t impossible. Otherwise, how could Zhou Wen, an Epic-stage human, suppress the Guardian so badly?</p>

<p>As for the smoke, it condensed into the appearance of Lie above Joseph.</p>
<p>This strange scene left everyone horrified. As Joseph constantly screamed, his body quickly dissipated, and the smoke transformed into the complete Lie.</p>
<p>However, the current Lie looked much more agile and strange than the previous Lie.</p>
<p>“What happened? Aren’t Guardians supposed to protect contractors? Why did it devour Joseph?” Everyone felt their blood run cold.</p>
<p>Lie floated in the air as it looked at Zhou Wen with its demonic eyes and said, “You defeated Joseph. Now, you have the right to succeed Joseph as God’s chosen one. I will bestow you supreme power.”</p>
<h1>Chapter 1001: Not Moving</h1>
<p>A faint fog seemed to appear on Joseph’s mysterious gray armor. The Bronze Sparrow Sword pierced through the armor and his chest. The tip of the sword was revealed behind him as flames burned crazily.</p>
<p>“Die!” Joseph felt that such an attack was already powerful enough. He steeled his heart and wanted to transfer his injuries to the Bronze Sparrow Sword.</p>
<p>As the Bronze Sparrow Sword had injured him, he could only transfer it to the Bronze Sparrow Sword and not Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, before he could use Hypocritical Transaction to transfer his injuries, the Bronze Sparrow Sword had already exploded. A terrifying explosive force exploded in Joseph’s body like a nuclear bomb.</p>
<p><em>Not good!</em> Joseph’s expression changed drastically. The explosion of the Bronze Sparrow Sword instantly made him lose his target of damage transfer. Ignoring the fact that his injuries couldn’t be transferred, even Lie probably couldn’t withstand such a terrifying explosion.</p>
<p>Almost instantly, Joseph activated Lie’s Wheel of Destiny: False God Statue.</p>
<p><em>Boom!</em></p>
<p>Joseph’s body was blasted apart by the flames, shocking everyone watching. No one expected such a situation to happen.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Joseph’s figure suddenly appeared in a corner of the arena as he half-knelt on the ground. He wasn’t blasted to death. What was blasted to death was a fake statue that was akin to an avatar.</p>
<p>However, the injuries he had suffered previously couldn’t be transferred out. His chest was dripping with blood as his face turned pale. He looked like he was in a terrible condition.</p>
<p>In the silent arena, Zhou Wen held the Bronze Sparrow Sword’s scabbard which spewed out flames. It condensed a new Bronze Sparrow Sword that looked flawless.</p>
<p>“Wow! Too powerful… What kind of Companion Beast is that? It’s so cool. I’ve decided! I’ll create such Companion Beast figurines in the future…” Li Benyi exclaimed excitedly.</p>
<p>Li Benyu wore an odd expression. Zhou Wen’s strike had indeed exceeded his imagination.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say you were not going to move?” Zhou Wen asked Joseph.</p>
<p>“You… pulled a trick…” Joseph’s expression turned nasty as he gritted his teeth and stood up. He stared at Zhou Wen and continued, “Don’t be too smug. Schemes can only last for a while. In front of true strength, scheming is useless. I’ll let you know what true strength is.”</p>
<p>With that said, the Guardian armor on Joseph’s body emitted a mysterious fog. His injured chest and armor rapidly recovered in the mysterious fog. In the blink of an eye, he returned to normal as though he had never been injured.</p>
<p><em>What powerful recovery ability. It’s actually stronger than my self-healing ability?</em> Li Xuan widened his eyes in disbelief.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, that shouldn’t be ordinary self-healing, right?” Feng Qiuyan said after some thought.</p>
<p>Sadie used the Eye of Odin to see more clearly. She said, “It really doesn’t look like self-healing. It’s more like some kind of time-reversal ability that reverts his state to before he was injured.”</p>
<p>“That works too? Isn’t this too much of a bug? Such a scumbag actually has such a powerful Guardian. How depressing,” Li Xuan said.</p>
<p>Lance pondered and said, “I don’t think it’s that easy to use such a powerful force like reversing the flow of time. Perhaps, Joseph needs to pay a certain price.”</p>
<p>“What kind of price could it be?” Li Xuan asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Lance shook his head.</p>
<p>In the spectator stands, many people from Frost City began shouting Joseph’s name in unison.</p>
<p>To be able to escape from such a huge explosion and instantly recover from his injuries, he looked as powerful as a god.</p>
<p>However, they didn’t dare underestimate Zhou Wen now. The strike from the Bronze Sparrow Sword had left them somewhat horrified. Even now, they still felt their scalps tingle when they thought of that strike.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, are you prepared to suffer the wrath of God’s chosen one?” Joseph said coldly as he stared at Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen summoned some armor and put it on. He said with a smile, “Since you can’t abide by the agreement, it’s my turn to stand here motionless and let you attack. Feel free to attack. I’m always a man of my word. I won’t run.”</p>
<p>These words made Joseph’s expression turn nasty. He originally imagined that he could use Hypocritical Transaction to teach Zhou Wen a lesson, but he never expected Zhou Wen to counter him.</p>
<p>Now, Joseph knew that he had to suppress Zhou Wen to protect the image he had painstakingly built up in Frost City.</p>
<p>“You are tempting fate.” Joseph’s figure appeared in front of Zhou Wen like a phantom as he punched him in the chest.</p>
<p>Unlike ordinary people’s boxing techniques, there was a ring on the middle finger of Joseph’s fist. There was a spike on the ring. It was a poison spike that came with Lie’s armor. Coupled with the use of Essence Energy’s Sweet-Talking Punch, the poison produced when the poisonous sting stabbed into one’s body could make one hallucinate.</p>
<p>Even if Joseph didn’t kill Zhou Wen, Zhou Wen would still fall into an illusion. If his will wasn’t firm, he would commit suicide even without needing Joseph to do a thing.</p>
<p><em>Clang!</em></p>
<p>However, when Joseph’s fist struck Zhou Wen’s body, the poisonous sting failed to penetrate the armor at all. Under the powerful impact, the poisonous sting nearly snapped, but the armor remained unharmed.</p>
<p>“Impossible? How can it have such powerful defense?” Joseph refused to believe that his Guardian powers couldn’t break through Zhou Wen’s armor.</p>
<p>With that, Joseph quickly moved as he brandished his fists and struck Zhou Wen with all his might.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen wore the Shell Dragon Armor and had activated Absolute Defense. No matter how Joseph attacked, he couldn’t break through the armor.</p>
<p>No matter how strong Lie was, it hadn’t activated its Terror form. It was just too difficult to break through the Absolute Defense. Back then, Night Thearch hadn’t been able to directly penetrate the Absolute Defense, much less Joseph.</p>
<p>The people in the spectator stands were dumbfounded. Zhou Wen really stood there motionless, allowing Joseph to attack.</p>
<p>In their eyes, the god-like Joseph was now a weak child. No matter how he attacked, he couldn’t injure Zhou Wen at all.</p>
<p><em>That fellow… What’s going on…</em> A strange thought arose in many people’s hearts as they looked at Zhou Wen who was dressed in blue crystal armor as though he was protected by the stars.</p>
<p><em>Could it be that the strength of a Companion Beast is really stronger than a Guardian? </em>Although they were unwilling to believe it deep down, the image of a Guardian suddenly didn’t seem so lofty in their hearts when they saw Joseph fighting an adult like a child.</p>
<p>“What Companion Beast is this? It’s so powerful. Joseph can’t even leave a mark on the armor. It’s just too powerful…” Li Benyi’s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>Ya’er glanced at Li Benyi and felt that this fellow was so noisy as if he had never seen anything.</p>
<h1>Chapter 1002: Subversion</h1>
<p>The spectator stands were dead silent as everyone stared blankly at the battle in the arena.</p>
<p>Perhaps it couldn’t be called a battle. It was like a naughty child challenging a giant. Even if the giant stood there without moving, the naughty child couldn’t injure the giant at all.</p>
<p>Just as Joseph had said, it seemed to be the difference in absolute strength.</p>
<p>“Why… Why is this happening… Why can’t I break it…” Joseph changed his skills in an attempt to break through Zhou Wen’s armor.</p>
<p>However, it was completely useless. No matter what skill he used, it was blocked by the crystal-like armor. It couldn’t injure Zhou Wen at all.</p>
<p>Joseph’s heart sank to the bottom. He never imagined that he would lose to Zhou Wen, nor did he believe that he, who had a Guardian, couldn’t defeat a human without a contracted Guardian.</p>
<p>However, the truth was right before him. His heart was already palpitating, and his hands were trembling even more because he couldn’t see any hope of victory.</p>
<p>Now, Joseph was already regretting his decision to challenge Zhou Wen. Why did this darn Zhou Wen have so many terrifying Companion Beasts?</p>
<p>“Even if I kill you, you won’t be able to kill me. From the looks of it, there’s no need to continue fighting. This battle is a draw,” said Joseph as he suddenly retreated. He still wanted to preserve his final dignity.</p>
<p>However, his words made even the locals who had supported him find it unacceptable. All of them felt their faces burn.</p>
<p>“A loss is a loss. What do you mean by a draw? Can’t you act like a man?” a hot-tempered man in the stands shouted.</p>
<p>This was also what many people thought. They felt that Joseph should fight to the end. Even if he lost, it wouldn’t be as embarrassing as now.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen looked at Joseph without any expression. All he did was slowly dispel the Shell Dragon Armor and Bronze Sparrow Sword. He held the Bamboo Blade and said, “I won’t use any Companion Beasts. I’ll only use this Essence Gold Bamboo Blade to fight you. Do you dare fight?”</p>
<p>Instantly, the entire arena fell silent. Everyone suspected that there was something wrong with their ears or that Zhou Wen had gone mad.</p>
<p>The highest level humans could reach was the Epic stage. If they didn’t use Mythical Companion Beasts, they had no right to fight Guardians.</p>
<p>They admitted that Zhou Wen’s Companion Beasts were very strong. They were practically invincible. Without using Tyrant Behemoth, he had completely suppressed Joseph, who had a Guardian.</p>
<p>However, this didn’t mean that they believed that Zhou Wen was qualified to fight Joseph without a Companion Beast.</p>
<p>“Are you sure there’s nothing wrong with his brain?” Li Benyu was also stunned. He was originally rejoicing over Zhou Wen’s victory, but, to his surprise, Zhou Wen had said such crazy words.</p>
<p>Lance also stared at Zhou Wen with a burning gaze. He knew what Zhou Wen wanted to do because he had done the same thing, but he had failed.</p>
<p>“Of course he’s not crazy. He just wants to prove that a Guardian is nothing impressive. We humans can defeat a Guardian with our own strength,” Sadie said with a complicated expression.</p>
<p>Although this sounded terrifying, Sadie didn’t find it strange that Zhou Wen was capable of completing such a feat.</p>
<p>“But… Can humans really defeat Guardians?” Li Benyu couldn’t believe it.</p>
<p>Li Benyi also couldn’t believe it. He muttered to himself, “Using a human’s body to defeat a Guardian? Is that possible?”</p>
<p>Apart from Li Xuan, Feng Qiuyan, and Ya’er, no one in Frost City believed that Zhou Wen could do it.</p>
<p>Humans maxed out at the Epic stage. There was a huge gap between them and the Mythical stage. As for Guardians, they were the best amongst those at the Mythical stage. The difference between them was just too great. The gap was so wide that no one could see hope.</p>
<p>“Is he crazy? Without using a Companion Beast, he’s only at the Epic stage. What right does he have to fight the Guardian?”</p>
<p>“Victory blinds one.”</p>
<p>“I think victory makes people crazy.”</p>
<p>When the people in the stands snapped to their senses, they began discussing spiritedly. Clearly, they also felt that Zhou Wen had been blinded by victory.</p>
<p>“Are you really not going to use a Companion Beast to fight me?” Joseph looked at Zhou Wen in disbelief. He couldn’t believe that a person like Zhou Wen would make such a foolish decision.</p>
<p>“If I use a Companion Beast, even if it’s only at the Legendary stage, it will be considered my loss.” Zhou Wen immediately added, “However, I have a condition.”</p>
<p>“What condition?” Joseph found it normal. There was no reason for Zhou Wen to be such an idiot.</p>
<p>“Even if I lose using a Companion Beast, this battle can’t end before I admit defeat. Do you dare accept the challenge?” Zhou Wen had been observing the powers of Lie.</p>
<p>It was indeed a very strong Guardian. Although it wasn’t the kind with absolute strength, his abilities were unique.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen was confident that he could defeat Joseph, who had Lie, but he wasn’t completely confident that he could completely destroy Lie before Joseph admitted defeat.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou Wen had to force Joseph not to admit defeat. He had to fight him to the end.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Zhou Wen in shock, believing that he had definitely gone mad. How was this a condition? It was as though he had personally delivered himself to the gallows.</p>
<p>Joseph stared at Zhou Wen with bloodshot eyes. He felt like he had been greatly insulted.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to beat around the bush. Aren’t you just trying to say that we won’t rest until one of us dies? I’ll fulfill your wish. We won’t rest until one of us dies. However, if you use a Companion Beast, it will be your loss. I want you to commit suicide.” Joseph’s eyes were red as his face couldn’t help but grimace. His voice was filled with ruthlessness.</p>
<p>“Sure.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly.</p>
<p>“Everyone, you heard that, right? As a member of the Ultimate Family Clan, you can guarantee me fair treatment, right?” Joseph looked at the VIP stands in the arena and said.</p>
<p>There, the upper echelons of the Ultimate Family Clan were watching the battle.</p>
<p>“No one can violate the agreement here,” an elder said calmly as he walked to the stands.</p>
<p>Joseph was delighted when he saw the elder. He bowed respectfully before turning to Zhou Wen with a ferocious expression. “Zhou Wen, I’ll gladly accept your life.”</p>
<p>With that said, the Lie Guardian armor on Joseph’s body emitted a mysterious fog that charged at Zhou Wen with terrifying power.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen had already analyzed the various abilities of Lie back when Joseph attacked. He already had an idea of its strength.</p>
<p>He held the Bamboo Blade, but he didn’t pull it out of its scabbard. As though riding the wind and smoke like an immortal, he dodged Joseph’s strange attacks.</p>
<p>Everyone saw that Zhou Wen really didn’t use a Companion Beast and relied solely on his strength to fight Joseph. Furthermore, Joseph didn’t have the absolute advantage.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen’s elegant movement technique that resembled a transcendent flying immortal was deeply imprinted in many people’s minds.</p>
<p>“Can humans… really compete with Guardians?” The people who rejected the notion previously had their beliefs shaken.</p>
<p>That elegant figure was subverting their long-established beliefs.</p>
<h1>Chapter 1003: Slaying the Guardian</h1>
<p>Zhou Wen’s movement techniques and saber techniques were pleasing to the eye and looked extremely elegant.</p>
<p>Even with the help of the Guardian’s powers, Joseph’s Speed and Strength were stronger than Zhou Wen’s in all aspects; yet, he was ultimately unable to injure him.</p>
<p>Even ordinary people who didn’t know how strong or weak their combat strength was could tell that although Joseph’s Strength and Speed were great, his technique and realm were far inferior to Zhou Wen’s.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen relied solely on his technique and combat experience to forcefully make up for the difference in physique between the two.</p>
<p>The Mythical Transcendent Flying Immortal combined with the Mythical Heart Defying Sword made Zhou Wen appear no weaker in his battle with Joseph.</p>
<p>Joseph was alarmed. He believed that after having a Guardian, he was already one of the strongest humans. Ignoring normal humans, even people with Mythical Companion Beasts were probably no match for him.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Wen didn’t even use a Companion Beast. Just his strength, skills, and Essence Gold saber were enough to render him helpless. It was rather terrifying.</p>
<p>Joseph made up his mind. Previously, he had that strange sword that prevented the Guardian’s Hypocritical Transaction from finding a target to transfer. <em>Now that he can’t use Companion Beasts, I don’t believe that he can withstand the damage transfer. He can’t self-destruct, right?</em></p>
<p>However, with his previous experience, Joseph didn’t dare be careless against Zhou Wen. Although he felt that this move was feasible, he couldn’t activate the Wheel of Destiny again anytime soon. If his life ended up in danger, he couldn’t use the False God Statue to escape.</p>
<p>To prevent any accidents, Joseph made a decision.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen used the Bamboo Blade as a sword and used the Heart Defying Sword to perfection. The might of his sword moves also became stronger.</p>
<p>As for Joseph, he seemed to be completely suppressed by Zhou Wen. He seemed to be retreating in defeat.</p>
<p>The spectators were already dumbfounded when they saw this. They couldn’t believe that an Epic human could suppress Joseph, who had a Guardian.</p>
<p>“Joseph seems to be deliberately luring Zhou Wen into delivering greater might with his sword,” Sadie said.</p>
<p>“That’s indeed the case. From the looks of it, he still plans on using that damage transfer ability,” said Lance.</p>
<p>“He still hasn’t learned his lesson after suffering a loss. He just has to do it again,” Li Xuan said with a curl of his lips.</p>
<p>“The situation now is probably a little different. Zhou Wen is using an ordinary Essence Gold weapon and not a saber transformed from a Companion Beast. It’s impossible for him to let the Bamboo Blade leave his hand to attack Joseph. If the damage is transferred, it can be transferred to Zhou Wen. Even if Zhou Wen were to throw the saber out, Zhou Wen’s situation will be very bad if the saber is destroyed,” Gulli said.</p>
<p>Lance thought for a moment, but he couldn’t think of a way for Zhou Wen to nullify the damage transfer. He pondered and said, “Since Zhou Wen has agreed not to use Companion Beasts, there should be a solution. Let’s continue watching.”</p>
<p>With Joseph luring Zhou Wen to use greater strength, Zhou Wen’s might grew stronger and stronger. This was also what Joseph wanted. He wanted to use damage transfer to kill Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>Seeing that the time was ripe, Zhou Wen’s sword stance was like a storm. It was impossible for him to retract his force.</p>
<p>Joseph suddenly retreated, but the armor on his body condensed into a Guardian that looked like a devil. It faced the Bamboo Blade in Zhou Wen’s hand.</p>
<p>Bamboo Blade crisscrossed over Lie’s body like bolts of lightning, leaving deep marks on its body.</p>
<p>Without the augmentation of Mythical Strength, Zhou Wen’s Strength was still a little weak. The injuries he left on Lie weren’t deep.</p>
<p>Joseph was delighted when he saw this. Zhou Wen’s strength wasn’t as terrifying as he imagined. It was completely within the limits of Lie.</p>
<p>However, such a violent sword attack left many wounds in a short period of time. Even if these injuries couldn’t kill Zhou Wen, they could reduce him to a heavily injured state.</p>
<p>“Zhou Wen, you’re dead.” Joseph roared as he excitedly launched Hypocritical Transaction to transfer the Guardian’s injuries to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>However, in the next second, the excitement on Joseph’s face froze. He realized that the Guardian’s injuries couldn’t be transferred to Zhou Wen.</p>
<p>“Impossible… How can this be… You cheated… You used the power of a Companion Beast to withstand the Guardian’s damage transfer?” Joseph roared at Zhou Wen with bloodshot eyes.</p>
<p>The people in the spectator stands also felt that what Joseph said wasn’t impossible. Otherwise, how could Zhou Wen, an Epic-stage human, suppress the Guardian so badly?</p>
<p>“Do I need to cheat?” Zhou Wen said calmly as the Bamboo Blade’s aura suddenly increased.</p>
<p>Instantly, Zhou Wen’s aura reached a terrifying level. At the instant he brandished the Bamboo Blade in his hand, he seemed to vanish.</p>
<p>When he appeared again, he was already at the other end of the arena. He slowly returned Bamboo Blade to its scabbard.</p>
<p><em>Crack!</em></p>
<p>And in the sky, Lie’s body split into two and was killed on the spot.</p>
<p>Not far behind the Guardian, Joseph spat out a mouthful of blood and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>The arena was silent. Those who had doubted Zhou Wen moments ago now felt the coldness deep in their bones.</p>
<p><em>Is there a need to cheat? It really doesn’t seem like there’s a need. </em>This thought appeared in everyone’s minds.</p>
<p><em>The strength of humans can really kill Guardians! </em>Apart from that, an unbelievable thought sprouted in everyone’s hearts.</p>
<p>“You cheated… You cheated… It’s impossible for human strength to defeat a Guardian… It’s impossible for you to defeat me, a chosen one of God… You must be cheating…” The wounds on Joseph’s body were still bleeding, but he seemed to have gone mad. He ignored his injuries and struggled to get up and shout.</p>
<p>Zhou Wen didn’t kill him. After all, he was from the Ultimate Family Clan. It was better to leave him to the Ultimate Family Clan to deal with.</p>
<p>He originally imagined that the matter would end here, but gray smoke suddenly rose from Joseph’s body as though his body was turning into dust.</p>
<p>As for the smoke, it condensed into the appearance of Lie above Joseph.</p>
<p>This strange scene left everyone horrified. As Joseph constantly screamed, his body quickly dissipated, and the smoke transformed into the complete Lie.</p>
<p>However, the current Lie looked much more agile and strange than the previous Lie.</p>
<p>“What happened? Aren’t Guardians supposed to protect contractors? Why did it devour Joseph?” Everyone felt their blood run cold.</p>
<p>Lie floated in the air as it looked at Zhou Wen with its demonic eyes and said, “You defeated Joseph. Now, you have the right to succeed Joseph as God’s chosen one. I will bestow you supreme power.”</p>
